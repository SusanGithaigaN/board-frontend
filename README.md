# Job Board Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application for a job board, allowing employers to post job listings and job seekers to find and apply for those positions. The frontend is built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by Apollo GraphQL. The design inspiration comes from a Figma template found in the Figma community.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* **Backend:**
    * Apollo GraphQL: A powerful query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data.
* **Design:**
    * Figma: A collaborative web application for interface design, with inspiration drawn from a community template.

## Features

* **Job Listings:** Browse a list of available job openings.
* **Job Details:** View detailed information about a specific job posting.
* **Employer Posting:** Employers can create and manage job listings.
* **User Authentication:** (To be implemented) User registration and login for both job seekers and employers.
* **Application Process:** (To be implemented) Job seekers can apply for jobs through the platform.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes.
* **Modern UI:** Clean and modern user interface, inspired by the Figma design.

## Design Inspiration

The user interface design is based on the following Figma template:

* **Figma Template:** [Job Portal Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/design/6E8Ssvrc4AS26pKxU4eGgH/Job-Portal-Figma-Template--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=jLJ5ky0DDNXx91Fa-0)

* **Employer Dashboard:** (Screenshot of the employer dashboard - if implemented)

<!-- ## Installation and Setup -->

*(Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the project.  Assume the user has a basic understanding of Git, Node.js, and npm/yarn.)*

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend  # Navigate to the backend folder
    npm install    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up the backend environment:**

    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    * Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys).  Example:

        ```
        DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
        PORT=4000
        # Add other necessary variables
        ```
    * *(Provide specific instructions for setting up the database, if applicable.  Specify the type of database and any required configuration.)*

4.  **Run the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    * The server should now be running at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

5.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend  # Navigate to the frontend folder
    npm install    # or yarn install
    ```

6.  **Set up the frontend environment:**

    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.
    * Add the necessary environment variables. Example:

        ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000 # Or the URL of your GraphQL server
        ```

7.  **Run the frontend application:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    * The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

<!-- ##  Backend Setup (GraphQL with Apollo) -->

1.  **Define your GraphQL schema:** The schema defines the structure of your data and the operations that can be performed (queries and mutations).  *(Describe where the schema is located and provide an example if it's not straightforward.)*
2.  **Create resolvers:** Resolvers provide the implementation for each field in the schema. They fetch the data from your data source (e.g., a database, an API). *(Describe where the resolvers are located and how they interact with the data source.)*
3.  **Configure Apollo Server:** Set up the Apollo Server with your schema and resolvers.  Configure any necessary middleware (e.g., for authentication). *(Explain any specific Apollo Server configurations.)*
4.  **Database Connection:** Configure the connection to your database within your backend code.  *(Specify the database type and any connection details.)*

<!-- ##  Frontend Setup (React with Tailwind CSS) -->

1.  **Project Structure:** *(Briefly describe the main directories and files in your `frontend` directory.)*
2.  **Component Architecture:** *(Describe the main components and how they are organized.  For example: "The application uses a component-based architecture, with reusable components for job cards, forms, and navigation.")*
3.  **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** *(Explain any customizations you've made to the default Tailwind CSS configuration, such as custom themes, colors, or breakpoints.)*
4.  **API Interaction:** Explain how the frontend interacts with the backend GraphQL API (e.g., using `fetch`, `Apollo Client`).
5.  **State Management:** *(Describe how state is managed in the frontend (e.g., React useState, useContext, Redux, etc.).)*
6.  **Routing:** *(Describe the routing solution used (e.g., React Router) and the main routes in the application.)*

<!-- ##  Further Development -->

* Implement user authentication (registration and login).
* Develop the job application process.
* Add search and filtering functionality for job listings.
* Create employer dashboards for managing job postings.
* Implement user profiles for both job seekers and employers.
* Add testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
* Improve error handling and user feedback.
* Optimize performance.
